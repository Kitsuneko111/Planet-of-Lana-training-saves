Disclaimer:
This is entirely unofficial and not endorsed for cheating or any other unfair play. No shrines are collected, and there are intentional deaths along the way. These saves will not count for any achievements other than the basic story ones, so go do those yourself the game is beautiful.

## How this works
[WINDOWS PC ONLY]

Saves are located in [`%appdata%/../LocalLow/Wishfully/Planet Of Lana`](%appdata%/../LocalLow/Wishfully/Planet%20Of%20Lana). The files included are for the middle save slot. **It is recommended to backup your existing saves if you do not wish to corrupt them or lose progress.**
